## 🧠 What Is This Project About?

In this project you will build the control system for a self-driving car in a ROS 2 simulation. The car drives around a racetrack and your job is to make it stay on the path, control its speed, and complete laps as fast and accurately as possible.

You will work through a series of milestones, each building on the last:

1. **Explore the system** — Learn what topics the car publishes and subscribes to.
2. **Bring the car to life** — Implement the physics equations that describe how the car moves.
3. **Drive it manually** — Build a keyboard teleoperation node to drive the car yourself.
4. **Add cruise control** — Implement a PID speed controller so the car holds a steady speed.
5. **Make it autonomous** — Implement three different steering controllers (Lateral PID, Pure Pursuit, and MPC) so the car drives itself around the track.
6. **Monitor performance** — Build a lap analyzer that logs lap times, tracking error, and shows live graphs and 3D overlays in RViz.
7. **Report your results** — Compare your controllers and document your findings.

The car model is realistic: it has velocity as a state (not a direct input), meaning it accelerates and decelerates due to drag and friction — just like a real vehicle.

## 🚀 Quickstart

### 1. Build the Workspace
```bash
# Source ROS 2 Humble
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash

# Install build, simulation, and controller dependencies
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y python3-colcon-common-extensions \
  python3-numpy python3-scipy ros-humble-robot-state-publisher \
  ros-humble-rviz2 ros-humble-xacro

# Build the workspace (bicycle_sim, bicycle_control, track_environment)
cd /path/to/bicycle_gym-main
colcon build --symlink-install
source install/setup.bash
```

In every new terminal, source the ROS distribution and built workspace:

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
cd /path/to/bicycle_gym-main
source install/setup.bash
```

### 2. Launch Modes

| Mode | Launch Command | Section |
|---|---|---|
| **Base Simulation (CLI Testing)** | `ros2 launch bicycle_sim bicycle_sim.launch.py` | Milestones 1 & 2 |
| **Interactive Keyboard Teleop** | `ros2 launch bicycle_sim bicycle_sim.launch.py controller:=teleop` | Milestones 3 & 4 |
| **Lateral PID (Reactive)** | `ros2 launch bicycle_sim bicycle_sim.launch.py controller:=lateral_pid` | Milestone 5.2 |
| **Pure Pursuit (Geometric Preview)**| `ros2 launch bicycle_sim bicycle_sim.launch.py controller:=pure_pursuit` | Milestone 5.3 |
| **Extended Kinematic MPC (Optimal Preview)** | `ros2 launch bicycle_sim bicycle_sim.launch.py controller:=mpc` | Milestone 5.4 |

For keyboard teleoperation, start the keyboard driver in a second sourced terminal:

```bash
sudo apt install -y ros-humble-teleop-twist-keyboard
ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard
```

To request closed-loop cruise control in teleoperation mode:

```bash
ros2 launch bicycle_sim bicycle_sim.launch.py controller:=teleop use_cruise_control:=true
```

The launch file also supports `rviz:=false` and `analyzer:=false` to disable those nodes. For example:

```bash
ros2 launch bicycle_sim bicycle_sim.launch.py controller:=pure_pursuit rviz:=false
```

### 3. Inspecting the ROS Graph

Run these commands from a second sourced terminal while the simulation is running:

```bash
ros2 node list
ros2 topic list
ros2 topic info /state
ros2 topic info /throttle
ros2 topic info /steer
ros2 interface show nav_msgs/msg/Odometry
ros2 interface show std_msgs/msg/Float32
ros2 interface show geometry_msgs/msg/Twist
ros2 topic echo /state
```

### 4. Direct Actuator Testing

With the base simulation running, send actuator commands from another sourced terminal. Throttle/brake uses `[-1.0, 1.0]`; steering is in radians, with positive values turning left.

```bash
ros2 topic pub --once /throttle std_msgs/msg/Float32 "{data: 0.5}"
ros2 topic pub --once /steer std_msgs/msg/Float32 "{data: 0.30}"
ros2 topic pub --once /throttle std_msgs/msg/Float32 "{data: -1.0}"
```

### 5. Real-Time Telemetry & Graphing
```bash
# Install plotting and telemetry visualization tools
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y ros-humble-plotjuggler-ros rqt-plot

# Inspect live signals in rqt_plot:
ros2 run rqt_plot rqt_plot /telemetry/cte /telemetry/speed

# Or launch PlotJuggler for multi-topic time-series analysis:
ros2 run plotjuggler plotjuggler
```

Some telemetry topics are only available after the corresponding analyzer work is complete.

## Milestone 6: Free Exploration & Reference Resources

To connect your work in this lab to industrial autonomous vehicle systems, modern simulators, and production ROS 2 frameworks, explore the following organized learning resources. These materials illustrate how the 2D planar kinematic bicycle model extends into multi-body dynamics, 3D physics engines, and advanced sampling-based predictive control.

### 1. Four-Wheel Ackermann Kinematics & `ros2_control`
*Explore multi-body steering geometry and industrial ROS 2 controller architectures.*

In a physical 4-wheel vehicle navigating a turn, the inside front wheel must turn sharper than the outside wheel because it follows a smaller turning radius ($R - W/2$ vs $R + W/2$). Forcing both wheels to the same angle causes tire scrub, tread wear, and energy loss.

$$\tan\delta_{inner} = \frac{L}{R - \frac{W}{2}}, \quad \tan\delta_{outer} = \frac{L}{R + \frac{W}{2}}$$

### 2. Modern 3D Simulation Environments (Gazebo & MVSim)
*Bridge the gap between 2D planar kinematics and full 3D physics engines with tire friction dynamics.*

While kinematic models assume zero tire slip, physical vehicles experience tire deflection and friction saturation (Pacejka Magic Formula). 3D physics engines simulate suspension compliance, tire contact patches, sensor noise, and terrain.

### 3. Stochastic Sampling-Based Predictive Control (Nav2 MPPI)
*Explore model predictive path integral control for non-linear vehicle systems.*

Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control is an advanced algorithm that generates thousands of randomized candidate trajectories in parallel (using GPU or multi-core CPU) and averages them using path integral weighting to produce optimal controls without needing gradient-based solvers.

#### Curated Resources:
- [Nav2 MPPI Controller](https://index.ros.org/p/nav2_mppi_controller/) — Production real-time MPPI controller package in the ROS 2 Navigation stack with dynamic obstacle avoidance and customizable cost functions.

### 💡 Synthesis Task for Your Report:
In your `README.md` report, synthesize your takeaways from exploring these organized resources:
1. **Kinematics vs Multi-Body**: How 4-wheel Ackermann kinematics accounts for differing inner and outer wheel turning radii ($\delta_{inner}$ vs $\delta_{outer}$), and how this is modeled in `ros2_control`.
2. **2D vs 3D Simulation**: The computational and modeling trade-offs between lightweight 2D kinematic simulation and full 3D physics engines (Gazebo / MVSim).
3. **Deterministic vs Sampling Control**: How modern sampling-based controllers (Nav2 MPPI) differ in flexibility, obstacle handling, and compute requirements compared to deterministic optimization (MPC).
